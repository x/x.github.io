title: Hi, my name is Devon.

I'm an engineer interested in performance, scale, and distributed systems. I have a soft spot for lisps and the orginal Gameboy's not-exactly-z80 processor. My main jam is Python and Clojure but, in previous lives, wrote C, Ruby, JS, and Java.

I'm currently a Sr. Engineer at an awesome startup called [Chartbeat](https://chartbeat.com).

Find me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/dproi) and [github](http://github.com/x).
